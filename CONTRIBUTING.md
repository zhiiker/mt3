# How to Contribute

As this repo is intended mainly as a supplement to [our ISMIR 2021 paper](https://archives.ismir.net/ismir2021/paper/000030.pdf) and [our ICLR 2022 paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=iMSjopcOn0p), we're not actively seeking contributions other than bugfixes.
If you would like to contribute, there are just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License

this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.
